When a user drags files to upload their images and I have set accept-file-types=\".jpg,.jpeg,.png\", the user is still able to drag or select other types of files (.pdf, .docx, etc.). This causes the element to incorrectly count that a file has been uploaded. Additionally, if the \"multiple\" attribute is set to \"false\", even uploading a correct file type after \"uploading\"  an incorrect file type results in an error. Currently there is no logic in the onDrop handler to honor the setting.  So the drop zone accepts anything, while the file input only accepts the defined times. Moreover, this similar occurs when if a user chooses to \"browse to upload\", if the user decides to upload an incorrect file type then a similar error will occur. \r\n \r\n \r\n # DEMO\r\n### DEMO PARAMETERS\r\naccept-file-types  = \".jpg,.jpeg,.png\"\r\nmultiple = \"false\"\r\n\r\n### DEMOS\r\n\r\n**\"Drag Files Here\" Demo**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c6fe0bc-6571-45f1-8094-44a360e73fae\r\n\r\n\r\n**\"Browse to Upload\" Demo**\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d133c82d-bc7f-4a37-9207-246115098d83\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Reduced test cases\n\n_No response_\n\n### What operating system(s) are you seeing the problem on?\n\n_No response_\n\n### What browser(s) are you seeing the problem on?\n\n_No response_\n\n### What is the issue regarding ?\n\n@trimble-oss/modus-web-components\n\n### What version of npm package are you using ?\n\nV9.5.0\n\n### Priority\n\nMedium\n\n### What product/project are you using Modus Components for ?\n\nViewpoint HR Management\n\n### What is your team/division name ?\n\nViewpoint HRIS\n\n### Are you willing to contribute ?\n\nYes\n\n### Are you using Modus Web Components in production ?\n\nYes",

When an item is selected it emits the item for the consumer to use and immediately sets the dropdown value. There are use cases where the consumer needs to control the value update (or if it even gets updated at all).\n\n### Motivation and context\n\nOne use case where we don't want to update the dropdown value on selection is when we want to open a new tab and leave the old tab unchanged. In this case the consumer will open a new tab and handle selection.\n\n### What is the issue regarding ?\n\n@trimble-oss/modus-web-components\n\n### Priority\n\nHigh\n\n### What product/project are you using Modus Components for ?\n\nPrism\n\n### What is your team/division name ?\n\nViewpoint CMS\n\n### Are you willing to contribute ?\n\nYes\n\n### Are you using Modus Web Components in production ?\n\nNearly",

An alternate solution could be to expose an isDateEnabled function, which the user can then pass in to handle their specific logic. This is how Ionic handles the same type of functionality: https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/datetime#advanced-date-constraints\r\n\r\n### Motivation and context\r\n\r\nWe have a use case where the user has to select a date window to display machine data across. Machines however don't have data available every day; it would thus be useful to provide some visual affordance to guide the user towards picking days that actually do have data available, instead of picking dates and seeing an error message pop up.\r\n\r\n### What is the issue regarding ?\r\n\r\n@trimble-oss/modus-web-components\r\n\r\n### Priority\r\n\r\nMedium\r\n\r\n### What product/project are you using Modus Components for ?\r\n\r\nWorksOS / Machine Playback\r\n\r\n### What is your team/division name ?\r\n\r\nCCFS/Weka\r\n\r\n### Are you willing to contribute ?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Are you using Modus Web Components in production ?\r\n\r\n_No response_",

If initialized with a single option, it recognizes  the value from list of options, allowing further selections. With no initial value, users can select options from the list, which are styled as chips. \r\nHowever, if initialized with multiple options (as a comma-separated list), the component fails to recognize them, displays a \"no results found\" message, and prevents further selections. Ideally, the autocomplete should recognize comma-separated values from the list, display them as chips, and allow additional selections.\n\n### Reduced test cases\n\nhttps://codepen.io/Anaith-A/pen/KKLdLjO?editors=1010\n\n### What operating system(s) are you seeing the problem on?\n\nWindows\n\n### What browser(s) are you seeing the problem on?\n\nChrome\n\n### What is the issue regarding ?\n\n@trimble-oss/modus-web-components\n\n### What version of npm package are you using ?\n\nv0.28.0\n\n### Priority\n\nHigh\n\n### What product/project are you using Modus Components for ?\n\nSector portal\n\n### What is your team/division name ?\n\nMaps\n\n### Are you willing to contribute ?\n\nNone\n\n### Are you using Modus Web Components in production ?\n\n_No response_",

I believe this needs to be a flavor only for the use cases when the list within the autocomplete is way too long. a.) it would confuse the user why everything is showing without knowing any context, and b,) it could take forever to load a potenially irrelevant list. \n\n2.) Scroll the list to the selected item (to assure user of their selection): once the user selects something from the autocomplete list, and reopens the autocomplete, they should see their selection within the context of the list. The already selected item item shows with a checkmark on the right and is the second one from the bottom of the list. \n\n\n**This is going to be addressed in a separate issue:** \n3.) If this is a multliselect autocomplete: show chips ABOVE the input field (not inside). When chips are created, and the field is reopened, the first selection in alphabetical order should be visible as the second from the bottom (unless it's the first one in the list or the last one in the list). \n\nhttps://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components/issues/2446",

In the absence of  `placeholder`, the Select component should not display any placeholder text. Instead, the \"currently selected\" value should appear blank, aligning with the behavior observed in other input elements, such as text inputs\r\n\r\n**Behavior When placeholder Is Specified**:\r\nWhen `placeholder` is provided, it should exclusively serve as the \"currently selected\" value when no actual selection has been made. Importantly, this placeholder should not be included among the dropdown list's selectable options\n\n### Reduced test cases\n\n_No response_\n\n### What operating system(s) are you seeing the problem on?\n\nWindows\n\n### What browser(s) are you seeing the problem on?\n\n_No response_\n\n### What is the issue regarding ?\n\n@trimble-oss/modus-web-components\n\n### What version of npm package are you using ?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Priority\n\nMedium\n\n### What product/project are you using Modus Components for ?\n\nWork Center\n\n### What is your team/division name ?\n\nTrimble Viewpoint\n\n### Are you willing to contribute ?\n\nMaybe\n\n### Are you using Modus Web Components in production ?\n\n_No response_",

For example, the Table can combine an HTML table along with other modus components (such as pagination) to create a unified experience.\r\n\r\nDropdown I don't feel is this way as it relies on an extra button, passing the id between the dropdown and the button. I think the Dropdown component should already have a button embedded into it and expose the button label. Also using id's can lead to fragile component.\r\n\r\nIn addition, if `The dropdownList slot was built to work with the <modus-list> and <modus-list-item> elements.`, why not just make dropdown list items a formal component element as opposed to imposing requirements such as `The item size property should be set to 'condensed'.`?\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```html\r\n<modus-dropdown toggle-element-id=\"toggleElement\">\r\n  <modus-button id=\"toggleElement\" slot=\"dropdownToggle\" show-caret=\"true\">Dropdown</modus-button>\r\n  <modus-list slot=\"dropdownList\">\r\n    <modus-list-item size=\"condensed\" borderless>Item 1</modus-list-item>\r\n    <modus-list-item size=\"condensed\" borderless>Item 2</modus-list-item>\r\n    <modus-list-item size=\"condensed\" borderless>Item 3</modus-list-item>\r\n  </modus-list>\r\n</modus-dropdown>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```html\r\n<modus-dropdown label=\"Dropdown\">\r\n  <modus-dropdown-item size=\"condensed\" borderless>Item 1</modus-dropdown-item>\r\n  <modus-dropdown-item size=\"condensed\" borderless>Item 2</modus-dropdown-item>\r\n  <modus-dropdown-item size=\"condensed\" borderless>Item 3</modus-dropdown-item>\r\n</modus-dropdown>\r\n```\n\n### Motivation and context\n\n_No response_\n\n### What is the issue regarding ?\n\n@trimble-oss/modus-web-components\n\n### Priority\n\nMedium\n\n### What product/project are you using Modus Components for ?\n\nModusBlazor\n\n### What is your team/division name ?\n\nAECO\n\n### Are you willing to contribute ?\n\nNone\n\n### Are you using Modus Web Components in production ?\n\n_No response_",

I would like consistency and to have child elements as they are a cleaner way of structuring static content.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<modus-breadcrumb></modus-breadcrumb>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\n  const modusBreadcrumb = document.querySelector('modus-breadcrumb');\r\n  const crumbs = [\r\n    { id: '1', display: 'Crumb 1' },\r\n    { id: '2', display: 'Crumb 2' },\r\n    { id: '3', display: 'Crumb 3' },\r\n    { id: '4', display: 'Crumb 4' },\r\n  ];\r\n  modusBreadcrumb.crumbs = crumbs;\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nCould be:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<modus-breadcrumb>\r\n  <modus-breadcrumb-item item-id=\"1\">Crumb 1</modus-breadcrumb-item>\r\n  <modus-breadcrumb-item item-id=\"2\">Crumb 2</modus-breadcrumb-item>\r\n  <modus-breadcrumb-item item-id=\"3\">Crumb 3</modus-breadcrumb-item>\r\n  <modus-breadcrumb-item item-id=\"4\">Crumb 4</modus-breadcrumb-item>\r\n</modus-breadcrumb>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change would still allow flexibility in JS, but would have a cleaner look and feel as well as support static OR prerendered data better.\r\n\r\nNavbar:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<modus-navbar\r\n  id=\"working\"\r\n  show-apps-menu\r\n  show-help\r\n  show-main-menu>\r\n  <div slot=\"main\" style=\"height:300px;\">Render your own main menu.</div>\r\n  <div slot=\"addMenu\">Render your own add menu.</div>\r\n  <div slot=\"notificationMenu\">Render your own notification menu.</div>\r\n  <div slot=\"profileMenu\">Render your own profile menu content.</div>\r\n</modus-navbar>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\n  const element = document.querySelector('modus-navbar');\r\n  element.apps = [\r\n    {\r\n        description: 'The One Trimble Design System',\r\n        logoUrl: 'https://modus.trimble.com/favicon.svg',\r\n        name: 'Trimble Modus',\r\n        url: 'https://modus.trimble.com/',\r\n    },\r\n  ];\r\n  element.logoOptions = {\r\n    primary: {\r\n      url: 'https://modus-bootstrap.trimble.com/img/trimble-logo-rev.svg',\r\n      height: 24,\r\n    },\r\n    secondary: { url: 'https://modus.trimble.com/favicon.svg', height: 24 },\r\n  };\r\n  element.profileMenuOptions = {\r\n    avatarUrl: '...',\r\n    email: 'modus_user@trimble.com',\r\n    initials: 'MU',\r\n    username: 'Modus User',\r\n    links: [\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"link1\",\r\n        display: \"Link 1\",\r\n        icon: \"moon\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        id: \"link2\",\r\n        display: \"Link 2\",\r\n        icon: \"sun\"\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  };\r\n  element.buttons = [\r\n    { id:'addMenu', icon: 'add' },\r\n    { id: 'notificationMenu', icon: 'notifications' }\r\n  ];\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nCould be:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<modus-navbar\r\n  id=\"working\"\r\n  show-apps-menu\r\n  show-help\r\n  show-main-menu>\r\n  <div slot=\"main\" style=\"height:300px;\">Render your own main menu.</div>\r\n  <div slot=\"addMenu\">Render your own add menu.</div>\r\n  <div slot=\"notificationMenu\">Render your own notification menu.</div>\r\n  <div slot=\"profileMenu\">Render your own profile menu content.</div>\r\n  <modus-navbar-app>\r\n    <modus-navbar-app-item description=\"The One Trimble Design System\" logoUrl=\"...\" url=\"...\">Trimble Modus</modus-navbar-app-item>\r\n  </modus-navbar-app>\r\n  <modus-navbar-logo-options>...</modus-navbar-logo-options>\r\n  <modus-navbar-buttons>...</modus-navbar-buttons>\r\n</modus-navbar>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Reduced test cases\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### What operating system(s) are you seeing the problem on?\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### What browser(s) are you seeing the problem on?\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### What is the issue regarding ?\r\n\r\n@trimble-oss/modus-web-components\r\n\r\n### What version of npm package are you using ?\r\n\r\n0.16.0\r\n\r\n### Priority\r\n\r\nMedium\r\n\r\n### What product/project are you using Modus Components for ?\r\n\r\nModusBlazor\r\n\r\n### What is your team/division name ?\r\n\r\nAECO\r\n\r\n### Are you willing to contribute ?\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Are you using Modus Web Components in production ?\r\n\r\n_No response_",

We've decided to default to `true` to avoid introducing a breaking change, while also maintaining consistency with the existing `show-` prefix nomenclature in our properties.\n\n### Motivation and context\n\nThere are scenarios where providing the user the option to sign out is unfavorable.  In the known instances, the profile menu is not necessary.  The provided scenarios were:\r\n1. Tekla Assistant window that is opening a website inside a desktop application, providing user details or sign out options does not make sense in this context\r\n2. e-Builder popup windows - Signing out from a popup window does not make sense based on desired user flow. The user should not be able to navigate to another page via profile menu links that take them back to the full page experience inside a popup window.  User delegation feature allows for switching of user context which could create confusion as the main page wouldn't update to reflect immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough this leads to the ability to use the `buttons` prop to define your own avatar button, this is not a supported use case by the modus design system.  To comply with guidelines, if a profile and profile menu are needed then the built in profile should be used.  \n\n### What is the issue regarding ?\n\n@trimble-oss/modus-web-components\n\n### Priority\n\nMedium\n\n### What product/project are you using Modus Components for ?\n\nModus\n\n### What is your team/division name ?\n\nModus\n\n### Are you willing to contribute ?\n\nNone\n\n### Are you using Modus Web Components in production ?\n\n_No response_",

I added the 'angular-16' workspace to Modus Web Components a while back and these were the equivalent steps I took to do that.\r\n\r\n- Made of a copy of the `modus-web-components\\angular-workspace\\ng16` folder and name it ng17.\r\n- In the `package.json` in that folder, update engines (node) to `>=18.13.0` \r\n- Read through the upgrade guide and follow the steps: https://update.angular.io/?v=16.0-17.0\r\n- In the root `package.json` there are steps to `build-angular` - will need to `&& cd ../ng17 && npm ci && npm run build` to the end\r\n- Make a PR with the above changes and we'll get it merged and published! :-) ",

Since the current table is setup to truncate by default, we should leave that.  My suggestion is to add a `wrap-text` property that defaults to `false`.  When enabled, it will remove the css that currently causes the body text to be truncated with ellipsis.  I do not expect this setting to affect the header or the footer.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, padding needs to be maintained.  Currently, the `<tr>` has its height set relative to its `density`.  Each column type should ensure that it's effective padding is maintained between wrapping and non-wrapping configurations.\r\n\r\nCurrently looks like this:\r\n![image](https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components/assets/1130129/e82e1d1b-c11b-484c-9647-9bc3d435e6c6)\r\n\r\nAfter changes, it could look like this:\r\n![image](https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components/assets/1130129/b7dd3400-ce8b-4b3d-a405-3d8c51eec5fd)\r\n\n\n### Motivation and context\n\nCurrently columns are displayed which can show a large block of text.  Since this text is truncated, users cannot scan or otherwise search for a specific row based on the value of the cell.  By adding back text wrapping, the table can function the same as a standard table and gives us the control on whether its more valuable to have fixed and predictable row heights, or all the text in the cells being displayed with irregular row heights.\n\n### What is the issue regarding ?\n\n@trimble-oss/modus-web-components\n\n### Priority\n\nMedium\n\n### What product/project are you using Modus Components for ?\n\ne-Builder\n\n### What is your team/division name ?\n\ne-Builder\n\n### Are you willing to contribute ?\n\nNone\n\n### Are you using Modus Web Components in production ?\n\n_No response_",

What I don't enjoy about most resize handlers is that I expect to be able to drag the border but can't and have to move my mouse over to the left at least a pixel in order to get the handler.  The above solved for that.  There may be more modern ways to do the same thing.  I'd be curious if something like this can be implemented, as it would create a larger target and a more intuitive one.  \r\n\r\n![DragHandlerEB](https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components/assets/1130129/3607d468-a757-4238-b3b7-c5913a8e78ed)"

The only trouble may come in depending on overflow being auto.  In my experience the two don't play together nicely, but this might be a solved problem by someone.  The current `modus-table` has a wrapper of `table-container` which sets `overflow: auto` which will probably give some trouble.  "

Which elements the fill color property values are set on. Some set the fill on the `svg`, and others on the `path` elements.\r\n2. Which colors are used as the default values for those properties. Some use `'currentColor'`, others use `#6A6976` or `#252a2e`\r\n\r\nTo resolve these issue and improve icon consistency, I suggest a few changes:\r\n1. Use the `fill` property on the `svg` elements inside of the icon components, rather than the `path` elements\r\n2. Default the `fill` property value to `'currentColor'` - which means that the fill color of that path will be the same as the color property of the element or its parent element (see example: https://jsfiddle.net/s4c1e2nu/1/)\r\n3. Use a constant value for the icon default size of `16`\r\n\r\n### Reduced test cases\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### What operating system(s) are you seeing the problem on?\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### What browser(s) are you seeing the problem on?\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### What is the issue regarding ?\r\n\r\n@trimble-oss/modus-web-components\r\n\r\n### What version of npm package are you using ?\r\n\r\nLatest\r\n\r\n### Priority\r\n\r\nMedium\r\n\r\n### What product/project are you using Modus Components for ?\r\n\r\nWork Center\r\n\r\n### What is your team/division name ?\r\n\r\nTrimble Viewpoint\r\n\r\n### Are you willing to contribute ?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Are you using Modus Web Components in production ?\r\n\r\n_No response_",

This poses an issue for us when supplying translation strings in angular, since the html template is responsible for translating; I imagine this is a more general issue with translations that isn't specific to angular.\r\n\r\nI'm proposing altering the way tabs work to use slotted content for each tab (a good example of this can be found [here](https://shoelace.style/components/tab-group)). This makes it much easier for an implementer to use the tabs component.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, tab components tend to include slots for the content to display when each tab is active. This is less of a requirement and more of a nice to have if possible.\n\n### Motivation and context\n\nProviding component layout via an object rather that through slotted/projected content is not a developer friendly way of doing things. It also requires that the implementer looks after the state of the current active tab in order to render content relating to the tab. This is something the Modus component could do for us.\n\n### What is the issue regarding ?\n\n@trimble-oss/modus-web-components, @trimble-oss/modus-angular-components\n\n### Priority\n\nLow\n\n### What product/project are you using Modus Components for ?\n\nPredesign, AddLocation, Spaces\n\n### What is your team/division name ?\n\nHabitat/SketchUp\n\n### Are you willing to contribute ?\n\nYes\n\n### Are you using Modus Web Components in production ?\n\nno",

Whilst I understand that people have requested icons on a case-by-case basis, it doesn't make sense to me that these are added ad-hoc. In my opinion, if Modus WCs support modus icons, then all icons should be available for use. \r\n\r\nI can see in the source code that you are using the svg's directly and have individual components for each, which probably explains why all the icons have not yet been implemented, however an alternative approach might be to use the modus icons font as this would support all icons out of the box and any future changes to modus icons would be very easy to update to.\r\n\r\n### Motivation and context\r\n\r\nA lot of the icons we use in our products are not currently in Modus WCs. We are currently starting work to transition from our own Modus-based UI library to using Modus WCs\r\n\r\n### What is the issue regarding ?\r\n\r\n@trimble-oss/modus-web-components\r\n\r\n### Priority\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n### What product/project are you using Modus Components for ?\r\n\r\nPredesign, AddLocation, Spaces\r\n\r\n### What is your team/division name ?\r\n\r\nHabitat/SketchUp\r\n\r\n### Are you willing to contribute ?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Are you using Modus Web Components in production ?\r\n\r\n_No response_",

You can set up notifications for these. I use the browser extension which works really well: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/notifier-for-github/lmjdlojahmbbcodnpecnjnmlddbkjhnn\r\n\r\n- **Dependabot for GitHub**: If you use GitHub to host your code you can set up dependabot to automatically create a PR for new dependencies. It's very configurable - you can choose how often to check (daily, weekly or monthly). We use this on all the Modus projects and it can be integrated with CI/CD so you can get a deploy preview with each dependency update. https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuring-dependabot-version-updates\r\n\r\n- **Node Check Updates**: You can add a script to your package.json and name it something like 'check-updates' and enter the script: npx npm-check-updates. It'll check for updates and report which ones are available. You can even configure it to automatically update dependencies if you want and exclude others. I use this regularly and recommend it.

            "> The Modus Approval Board has confirmed that it is not possible to have a tooltip on disabled elements and it cannot be focused on using the tab key.\r\n\r\nThis is only true partially. It is correct that elements using the disabled attribute (e.g. `<button disabled />`) cannot be focused via keyboard. However, it is also possible to implement `disabled` with `aria-disabled=\"true\"` and preventing the default behavior on click/keypress etc. This would keep the button as focusable, which in turn would allow using tooltips on such buttons. Has this alternative been considered?\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button\r\n  aria-disabled=\"true\"\r\n  onclick={(e) => e.preventDefault()}\r\n>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother usecase when the above approach would be preferred: when disabling the button when it is in a [\"loading\" state](https://modus-web-components.trimble.com/?path=/docs/components-button--default#loading-button) (e.g. while a form is submitting). When the user has such submit button focused, then presses the button, then toggling `disabled` attribute will lose the focus (because disabled buttons cannot be focused). This kind of loss of context results in confused users and should be considered a bug.\r\n\r\nP.S. I generally agree that marking the field as required, keeping the submit button enabled and showing errors on submit is a lot more clear solution for everyone, just that the technical reason for not allowing the requested usage is not 100% valid.\r\n",

In such cases, I've observed the following problems:\r\n\r\n**Incorrect Handling of Invalid Dates:** When entering an invalid date like \"31-09-2023,\" the calendar interprets it as \"01-09-2023.\" This behaviour is inaccurate, and it would be more appropriate to implement validation that highlights or notifies users about such errors.\r\n\r\n**Handling of Invalid Dates like 30-02-2023:** Similarly, when inputting an invalid date like \"30-02-2023,\" the calendar interprets it as \"02-03-2023.\" and it would be beneficial to implement validation that either highlights the error or prevents the entry of such invalid dates during manual input.\r\n\r\nI believe addressing these issues would improve the accuracy and reliability of the date picker's manual input functionality.

I have seen that the `#shadow-root` stops me to do some things.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/trimble-oss/website-modus.trimble.com/assets/1312938/a3976272-6616-46e3-8515-57deb99f5cd8)\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nPS.\r\nI have also added `size=large` seems too small.

We won't implement this property if the color isn't set to danger.  That is something that can be added later if a strong need is brought up.

            "# NavBar - Search Tooltip\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\nAdd ability to set a tooltip on the search button.\r\n\r\n## Implementation Details\r\nIn order to set the label, we propose a new optional prop `searchLabel`.  This allows for internationalization to be handled externally, and to set the standard for the other icons when they get tooltips.  The `IconSearch` will be wrapped in a `modus-tooltip`.  The label will be passed directly into it, and the tooltip component already handles when no text is provided.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{this.showSearch && (\r\n  <div class=\"navbar-button search\">\r\n    <span class=\"navbar-button-icon\">\r\n      <modus-tooltip text={this.searchLabel} position=\"bottom\">\r\n        <IconSearch size=\"24\" />\r\n      </modus-tooltip>\r\n    </span>\r\n  </div>\r\n)}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom there documentation will be updated.\r\n\r\n## Considerations\r\n\r\n1. Is it acceptable to add a new prop for each icon (searchLabel, notificationsLabel, userMenuLabel, etc)?  \r\n2. Should we have default values for the tooltips?  "

            "# NavBar - Add Button Proposal\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n- An Add button added to `NavBar` to support e-Builder\u2019s Quick Add functionality\r\n- Add button, when clicked, can show content provided through the implementation\r\n\r\nThis is one of 2 or 3 icons that the e-Builder product is looking to add.\r\n## Original Implementation\r\nThe original design added the `Add` icon using the same pattern as the other icons. A `show-add` prop was added to the `ModusNavbar` component along with an accompanying `addMenuOpen` event.\r\n\r\nIt was requested that an alternative approach be created to better support product specific use cases.  \r\n\r\n## Alternative Suggestion\r\nA collection is provided that defines icons to insert into the `NavBar`. The following schema is suggested:\r\n```\r\n// An array of items with this definition at minimum\r\n{\r\n  id: string;\r\n  label string;\r\n  icon: string;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nA label property for tooltips (another issue we are working on), can be omitted until that work is done.\r\nAn icon property can function like the `SideNav` items that accepts either a built-in icon or an image url.\r\n\r\nFor slots, we can either request the use of `<div slot=\"{id}\"></div>` or request the slot name be provided. A generic wrapper component can be created to wrap a `<slot name=\"{id}\"></slot>`. This could also replace the existing notifications menu component.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, something like `navItemClick` or `navItemOpen` event.\r\n\r\n## Considerations\r\n1. Should there be a limit to the number of icons? e-Builder will need potentially 3 icons (Add, Reports, Accessibility... not sure if finalized). If considered, can limiting the amount be considered outside the scope of this work?\r\n2. Do we only one to support built in icons, so nothing crazy gets added to the `NavBar`, or is that too restrictive?\r\n3. Should there be more control on placement?  We are looking to have these icons after the `search` icon.  Modus guidelines do state \"...any additional buttons should be placed in-between Search and Notifications\"\r\n4. Would there be any desire to have some or all of the existing icons (except profile) use this mechanism?  Such as the pendo placeholder, which is outside the current default specification for modus as well.  If considered, can this be outside the scope of this work?\r\n\r\n\r\n",
            "cc @coliff @ryan-henness-trimble \r\nhey @cjwinsor I love the idea of passing an array for navbar icons. \r\n\r\n1. Anything in the below-highlighted group is optional and any product can choose to add or change the order of the elements. The array configuration will be really useful and it can prevent adding separate configurations for tooltips.\r\nMy only concern is the existing icons notifications and help, also are optional and I would recommend those to be part of the array too.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50131391/236254609-bca8e993-c43a-45c8-a436-8eba6ae99e48.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  I think it is okay to not limit the icons at the moment and it's better to accept both the icon name and the icon URL because the existing Modus icons set(https://modus-icons.trimble.com/) is huge and I don't know whether all those icons will be made available inside web components.\r\n\r\n3. I talked to @egunther39  about the placements and you are right about the search icon. Where did you find the text  \"...any additional buttons should be placed in-between Search and Notifications\"  ?\r\n\r\n",
            "@msankaran0712 That line about placement was on the [Design System Page](https://modus.trimble.com/components/web/navbars/styles/#specifications).  \r\n\r\nI later saw that the responsive design details indicates the expectation for collapsing the icons, so in theory the count shouldn't matter as long as we implement some collapsing ability when responsiveness is added.\r\n\r\nNotifications, Help, and maybe even the pendo placeholder, could be handled in the array.  That could be additional scope later as a planned deprecation, or we could remove them as a breaking change as part of this work.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts or suggestions on the name of the array?  \r\n\r\nLet me know when we are good to start on this change and we'll get it going asap.",
            "@cjwinsor \r\nIt is safe to remove the pendo placeholder completely. \r\nI suggest we remove notifications and help and add them to the array now, it has to be done sooner or later. \r\n@ryan-henness-trimble Please let us know if you think otherwise. \r\n\r\nThere is no other reason for delaying this work, once @ryan-henness-trimble confirms we should be good to start :)\r\n\r\nFor the array's name, maybe `items`. Please proceed with whatever name you think is appropriate for now.\r\n",
            "The Pendo placeholder is good to remove \ud83d\udc4d \r\n\r\nI like the alternative of passing in the icons as a collection. Here are some schema considerations I thought of:\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n  id: string;\r\n  tooltip: string; // Renamed 'label'\r\n  icon: string;\r\n  type: 'solid' | 'outline' | 'transportation'; // Not sure if this would be needed\r\n  orderIndex: number; // Details the position of the icon (so that it is more explicit than array order)\r\n  priority: number; // Details the priority level for responsive collapsing\r\n  menu?: 'pop-out' | 'left-side-bar' | 'right-side-bar' | undefined; // The menu type (if left null/undefined, no menu is provided)\r\n  disabled: boolean; // Whether the icon is disabled\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRegarding\r\n> I think it is okay to not limit the icons at the moment and it's better to accept both the icon name and the icon URL because the existing Modus icons set (https://modus-icons.trimble.com/) is huge and I don't know whether all those icons will be made available inside web components.\r\n\r\nAs a consumer, I would expect all of the Modus icons to be available through this dynamic collection passed into the navbar. We should consider adding an issue to get the icons added to the `IconMap`, or possibly consume the `@trimble-oss/modus-icons` package. Consuming the icons package seems like it would be much cleaner",
            "We are going to move forward with the following schema for now\r\n```ts\r\n{\r\n  id: string;\r\n  tooltip: string; // Renamed 'label'\r\n  icon: string;\r\n  orderIndex: number; // Details the position of the icon (so that it is more explicit than array order)\r\n  menu?: 'pop-out' | undefined;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe'll we leaving the existing icons to be deprecated later. We will use the location we had the + icon added as our location to insert in new icons for now.  A new component will be created as well which will serve as a generic pop-out container.\r\n",

The [color-scheme CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color-scheme) is always on lightmode. it's not a major problem, it just means some OS level controls like the scrollbar and autocomplete input form fields are always light.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1.

This would apply the theme globally\r\n- [x] Component Level - Set the theme directly on the component with a CSS attribute, which would override the Page Level setter\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### \r\n\r\n- [x] #787\r\n- [x] #788 \r\n- [x] #789 \r\n- [x] #796\r\n- [x] #797\r\n- [x] #800\r\n- [x] #801\r\n- [x] #802\r\n- [x] #803\r\n- [x] #804\r\n- [x] #805\r\n- [x] #843\r\n- [x] #853\r\n- [x] #874\r\n- [ ] maybe #847\r\n\r\nOnce we've got our pattern for setting the theme on the Page Level, a `ThemeToggle` component should be created that will switch the theme globally.

Include optional `modus-tooltip` when the item content overflows to hidden. \r\nAdd styling for when the item is being dragged. This work could be included in a separate story.\r\n\r\n#### Barebones `modus-content-tree`\r\n> Build barebones `modus-content-tree` which displays parent/child items that can be expanded and collapsed on button click. This content tree will take a JavaScript object as its input, it will not be composable. It will take the object and compose it itself using the `modus-list-item` component. This should give us better leverage for the Action functionality since we will be able to modify the object and output its changes.\r\nIt is important to try to define a good input model for these items that can be extended to fit the needs of all the Actions.\r\n\r\n#### Barebones Action bar\r\n> Build barebones `modus-content-tree` Action bar.

            "@ryan-henness-trimble @coliff \r\n\r\n## TLDR\r\n\r\nIn the process of building the Angular library from the stencil web components, I have found all of the manual steps that need to be done to build the library. We originally agreed that the best approach would be to **generate everything on the fly** in the github action. I haven't actually tried this yet but I have ran into a few obvious hurdles with the **generate everything on the fly** approach.\r\n\r\nI think it would be much better use of our time to just accept that we might need to create an angular-workspace inside source control that will store the generated components.\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nHere are the steps that need to be performed to build an angular library and publish it to npm (Not in perfect order):\r\n\r\n**Bold items would be difficult / time consuming to implement using the \"generate on the fly\" approach**\r\n\r\n1. Install the angularOutputTarget dev dependency\r\n`> npm install @stencil/angular-output-target --save-dev`\r\n\r\n2. Update the stencil.config.ts to include:\r\n```ts\r\nangularOutputTarget({\r\n      componentCorePackage: \"@trimble-oss/modus-web-components\",\r\n      directivesProxyFile: \"./angular-workspace/projects/trimble-oss/modus-angular-components/src/lib/stencil-generated/components.ts\",\r\n      directivesArrayFile: \"./angular-workspace/projects/trimble-oss/modus-angular-components/src/lib/stencil-generated/index.ts\",\r\n    })\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Create an angular workspace\r\n`> npx -p @angular/cli ng new angular-workspace --no-create-application`\r\n\r\n4.  Create the modus-angular-components library (run from inside the angular workspace)\r\n`> npx -p @angular/cli ng generate library @trimble-oss/modus-angular-components`\r\n\r\n**5. Delete the placeholder components and services from the angular library**\r\n\r\n6. Build the stencil project (from the stencil project root directory)\r\n`> npm run build`\r\n\r\n**7. Import and Export all components into the angular module**\r\n\r\n**8. Update tsconfig to disable lib checks. This is required to allow us to extend the stencil HTML elements in Angular**\r\n\r\n9. Link the stencil root directory to the angular directory using `npm link`\r\n\r\n**10. Bump the angular library version number**\r\n\r\n11. Build the angular library:\r\n`> npx ng run @trimble-oss/modus-angular-components:build:production`\r\n\r\n12. Publish the angular library:\r\n`> npm publish`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

            "While working on this issue I came up with some thoughts:\r\n\r\nAs I started to wrap the Simple-Datatables library, I noticed that there's going to be issues with table functionality (paging, searching, filtering, etc.) when we've got more than one page of data. The table's functions only work with the data that is immediately plugged into the table, there is no easy way to hook into backend calls for paging/searching/filtering. \r\n\r\nSince hooking into backend paging/searching/filtering will probably be necessary in most cases, I think the only real functionality we gain from the table library is that the library will lay all of the data out in table headers/rows easily for us. But the downside of having the headers/rows layed out and rendered for us is that it makes it much harder to have custom control over these (for on click events, styling, etc.) The library provides a render argument that allows rendering of whatever you want in the cells, but it does not play nicely with Stenciljs, we're not able to reference any of the components methods unless we query for the component's public methods through the document/shadow dom (the render method injects whatever youre rendering into the dom as a string reference). \r\n\r\nThis library works great when we're able to pass the frontend all of the data at once. But when that is not the case for a basic table, I think I would lean toward building it out ourselves so that we have some more control, and it plays nicely with Stencil"

        "description": "## Bare minimum\r\n- Aria attributes\r\n- Tab index/order (focus)\r\n- Keyboard controls\r\n\r\n## Aria attributes\r\nWeb Accessibility Initiative, Accessible Rich Internet Applications\r\n\r\nWAI-ARIA helps by adding in further semantics that browsers and assistive technologies can recognize and use to let users know what is going on. \r\n\r\nThere are three main features:\r\n1. Roles - The role defines what an element is or does. There are different types (document roles, widget roles, landmark roles, etc.) The ones we'll be focusing on for this project are [widget roles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles#2._widget_roles).\r\n2. Properties - The properties define the parts of an element. (aries-required, arialabelledby, etc.) Here is a list of [aria properties and states that widgets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques#widget_attributes) use.\r\n3. States - Similar to properties, they describe the state of your widget. Linked above.\r\n\r\nOne of the questions I had was whether we wanted to have the library consumer pass in all of our WAI-ARIA properties, but it seems like it's going to be a mixed bag. We want to encapsulate as much as we can without hindering the consumer. I think we can set `role`, `state`, and some `properties` internally. One thing I can see the consumer wanting to set is the `label`.\r\n\r\nWC essential internal settings:\r\n- role\r\n- aria-checked\r\n- aria-disabled\r\n- aria-hidden, aria-modal\r\n- aria-invalid\r\n- aria-placeholder\r\n- aria-pressed\r\n- aria-readonly\r\n- aria-required\r\n- aria-valuemax\r\n- aria-valuemin\r\n- aria-valuenow\r\n- aria-labelledby (which is used with aria-label?)\r\n\r\nWC optional external settings:\r\n- aria-label\r\n\r\n## Tab index/order\r\nTabindex is an HTML attribute that can set an order for focusable elements which allow keyboard focus for non focusable elements and remove focus for a focusable element.\r\n\r\nFrom what I'm seeing, it looks the best practice is to use only values `-1`, and `0`. This is because once you start adding positive integers, it breaks off the DOMs natural tabbing order; tabbing follows the DOMs element layout naturally, and it is best to stick to that if we can.\r\n\r\n`tabindex: -1` - Does not allow the user to select with their tab key, but is able to be focused through JS.\r\n`tabindex: 0` - Allows non focusable elements to receive focus.\r\n\r\nFor the WC, I'm thinking we should set a tabindex of 0 for ones that should be focusable, and then rely on keyboard controls for any further interaction. Let's shy away of using tabbing to interact with the control other than focusing it. \r\n\r\n## Keyboard events\r\nUsing Stencil's `Listen()` decorator, we can listen to keyboard events and interact with the component accordingly. Gabe's got a good example in the `modus-select` component.\r\n\r\nUsing the w3 documentation below.\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\n- Does stencil provide a way of setting properties on the host element? This may be useful for our labelling so that the consumer does not need to know best practices, and we can implement it for them. -- Or is this even an issue? There may be good reason to keep everything encapsulated in the ShadowDOM, I have a feeling the DOM cannot access those and relate them.\r\n\r\n### Useful links\r\n- W3C has great [documentation for best a11y practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#aria_ex) for all types of components that should be reviewed before development.\r\n- Google has some good videos covering all of this\r\n    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lktz1KXbTOU&t=27s\r\n    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D25YXLBBX8\r\n    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REVxMvdBYMw\r\n- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/WAI-ARIA_basics\r\n- https://www.accessibility-developer-guide.com/introduction/\r\n- Chakra UI has some Accessibility built in that I should take a look at\r\n    - https://chakra-ui.com/docs/form/number-input#aria-roles",

Hello, I am using ModusDatePicker. I am passing in the value of the 'errorText' property as a controlled value. This value appears when there is an error only once. When I click outside of the component the error text goes away and the dates are still invalid. Can someone point me to more usages of this datepicker.

2489202274,2810,Table: Option to validate and pass error message for each table cell,['modus-table'],"### Prerequisites

- [X] I have [searched](https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components/issues?q=is%3Aissue) for duplicate or closed feature requests
- [X] I have read the [Modus style guidelines](https://modus.trimble.com/components/web/introduction/)

### Proposal

- Introduce an event `cellInputValueChange` that fires on input value change as the user type. This will be useful for consumers who wants to implement custom validation
- Introduce an optional `errors` property that allows the consumer to pass the error message for each cell. 

```
interface TableCellErrors {
  [rowIdorIndex: number]: { // if id is present in row data, use that, otherwise use index
    [accessorKey: string]: string;
  };
}
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- The component should emit cellInputValueChange event for every change in the input field 
- Updates to error object should be immediately reflected in the Table component
- Should set the cell error state even if the user changes focus - useful if the validation is done in the backend. 
- The documentation should include the possible options, and clearly describe how cellInputValueChange and cellValueChange differs.

### Motivation and context
Consumer side validation and custom error message is already possible in the input components, we are simply extending the behavior for table inline editing. As a next step, we should also consider validation inside the input components.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a245d670-bc52-4753-a623-b22fc334d3dd)

A regression was introduced impacting the sizing of the rowSelection column for ModusTable. It now seems to act a fluid box or something strange, though I don't see anything in css. It might be the internal width calculation.

I can reproduce this in our project by simply changing the installed version of modus.

You can work around it by manually setting the width of the other columns, though this is pretty terrible.

#2014 might be relevant/fix. Unsure though.

- [X] I have read the [Modus style guidelines](https://modus.trimble.com/components/web/introduction/)

### Proposal

Introduce an optional 'position' property that allows the component to be positioned relative to the item it is wrapping. it should accept various positioning options such as top, bottom, left, right, and auto, similar to how tooltips are positioned.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- By default, the date picker position should be bottom to ensure backward compatibility.
- The component should reposition seamlessly during page or container scroll.
- The documentation should include the possible options and their default values.

### Motivation and context

By introducing a dedicated position property, we can simplify the process and make it more intuitive for developers to align components accurately. This change will improve the flexibility and usability of the component, ensuring that it integrates seamlessly with various layouts and use cases.

- [X] I have read the [Modus style guidelines](https://modus.trimble.com/components/web/introduction/)

### Proposal

Introduce an optional 'position' property that allows the component to be positioned relative to the current element. it should accept various positioning options such as top, bottom, left, right, and auto, similar to how tooltips are positioned.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- By default, the autocomplete position should be bottom to ensure backward compatibility.
- The component should reposition seamlessly during page or container scroll.
- The documentation should include the possible options and their default values.


### Motivation and context

By introducing a dedicated position property, we can simplify the process and make it more intuitive for developers to align components accurately. This change will improve the flexibility and usability of the component, ensuring that it integrates seamlessly with various layouts and use cases.

### Describe the issue

The current style guide specifies using a tick icon to represent the active state for the ModusListItem right icon. However, this does not match the design presented in the Figma mocks.

PS: The component implemented the right icon as per the style guide, and there is no option to display a different icon, as it is reserved for the tick icon.

### Proposal

The current table component displays a number of row actions inline within a designated column. Once the inline space is exhausted, additional actions are placed within a context menu dropdown. This feature request proposes the ability to move all row actions to the context menu dropdown, removing them from the inline display entirely.

**Requirements:**
1. **Context Menu-Only Actions:**  
   - Provide an option to configure the table so that all row actions are placed within the context menu dropdown, with none displayed inline.
   
2. **Icons in Context Menu:**
   - Ensure that icons can be displayed next to individual row actions within the context menu.
   - Allow customization of icon colors within the context menu to give the consumer more control.

- [X] I have read the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Describe the issue

When using the autocomplete within the Modus Table, the dropdown that is extended is hidden behind the grid. I expect the dropdown to be in front of the grid. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c621ef6-d60b-4d3a-81bd-a0a66faf7f45)

To Reproduce: 

1. Setup a modus table with 1-2 records (small grid size) and configure one of the columns and set `cellEditorType`: ""autocomplete"" or ""date"". 

example:
```
{...
      cellEditable: true,
      cellEditorType: 'autocomplete', // or 'date'
      cellEditorArgs: {
        options:[
          { display: 'Cost center1' },
          { display: 'Cost center2' },
          { display: 'Cost center3' },
          ]        
      },
```
2. Try to open the dropdown. 
3. The dropdown will appear behind the grid container.

For tables with a small number of columns, the row actions column might become too large, and there is no way of controlling it, since there are no width properties the user can set.
This column could have a fixed width calculated by the number of actions in it. This already happens for tables with lots of columns, the row actions are fixed at the end of the row with a pre calculated width

Few columns and unnecessary large row actions width:

The datepicker is constrained entirely within the table's container, making it difficult or impossible to use depending on the location of the date field and the size of the container.

I would expect the datepicker to not be constrained by the container, as the location of the datepicker relative to its input is not critical, and this greatly impacts usability.

I've included screenshots of the storybook site and also the project I'm working on, where the effects are exacerbated by the small size of the table.

### Describe the issue

# DESCRIPTION
An issue with the File Dropzone element, specifically with the ""accept-file-types"" property. When a user drags files to upload their images and I have set accept-file-types="".jpg,.jpeg,.png"", the user is still able to drag or select other types of files (.pdf, .docx, etc.). This causes the element to incorrectly count that a file has been uploaded. Additionally, if the ""multiple"" attribute is set to ""false"", even uploading a correct file type after ""uploading""  an incorrect file type results in an error. Currently there is no logic in the onDrop handler to honor the setting.  So the drop zone accepts anything, while the file input only accepts the defined times. Moreover, this similar occurs when if a user chooses to ""browse to upload"", if the user decides to upload an incorrect file type then a similar error will occur.

### Describe the issue

Hello,
I have implemented the following directive to the best of my knowledge and belief.

If I get JSON for an element selected = true, this element should be selected for the user.

Currently I can only see that in the HTML Dom the value matches my expected selection (= document.getElementById) but the value visually still remains at the default value.

I guess, I have tried everything what cames into my mind.
If there are some default example available, then please share then I'm maybe able to find some differences.

2396201528,2682,Modus navbar dropdown should allow manual update on item select,['external-request'],"### Prerequisites

- [X] I have [searched](https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components/issues?q=is%3Aissue) for duplicate or closed feature requests
- [X] I have read the [Modus style guidelines](https://modus.trimble.com/components/web/introduction/)

### Proposal

Currently the modus navbar dropdown controls its own state. When an item is selected it emits the item for the consumer to use and immediately sets the dropdown value. There are use cases where the consumer needs to control the value update (or if it even gets updated at all).

### Motivation and context

One use case where we don't want to update the dropdown value on selection is when we want to open a new tab and leave the old tab unchanged. In this case the consumer will open a new tab and handle selection.

- [X] I have read the [Modus style guidelines](https://modus.trimble.com/components/web/introduction/)

### Proposal

Add an optional input property that accepts a list of dates which will be displayed in the date picker as clickable; dates not in the passed in list are displayed as disabled. An alternate solution could be to expose an isDateEnabled function, which the user can then pass in to handle their specific logic. This is how Ionic handles the same type of functionality: https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/datetime#advanced-date-constraints

### Motivation and context

We have a use case where the user has to select a date window to display machine data across. Machines however don't have data available every day; it would thus be useful to provide some visual affordance to guide the user towards picking days that actually do have data available, instead of picking dates and seeing an error message pop up.

- [X] I have read the [Modus style guidelines](https://modus.trimble.com/components/web/introduction/)

### Proposal

In most components such as the Navbar, instead of setting properties after render such as `showMainMenu` there is an action method such as `hideMainMenu`.

In the Utility Panel, the example suggests using an `expanded` property and setting it after rendering to control the expanded / collapsed state. Shouldn't this be a method to encapsulate post-render functionality?

Not sure what's the best here but I'm seeing an inconsistency.

### Describe the issue

In the example documentation:

```
<modus-utility-panel

      push-content=""${pushContent}""
      target-content=""${targetContent}"">

      <span slot=""footer"">Utility Panel Footer</span>

```

There is ambiguity related to `target-content` as it is defined twice. Why would one do this? Also what are the variables that are used inside of expanded, push-content and target-content?

### Motivation and context

When the user opens the application, no button is selected by default. As a result, the user has to manually select a button each time they enter. To enhance the UI, it is better to have a default button selected. This way, the user can still choose to select other buttons if needed, but they won't have to make an initial selection every time they open the application.

### Describe the issue

After upgrading to @trimbleinc/modus-bootstrap@0.31.1 I encountered that the icons that are loaded through the modus-button are transparent.

![image](https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components/assets/116563683/7c2d07c3-8a20-425b-89f6-551403c09390)


It looks like the import of the modus.min.css is now required to set the default colors, which wasn't the case in older versions.

My current workaround is to load the css from `@trimble-oss/modus-web-components/dist/modus-web-components/modus-web-components.css` manually.



### Reduced test cases

**Steps to reproduce:**
- Create a project without loading the modus-web-components.css
- Add: `<modus-button button-style=""borderless"" color=""secondary"" icon-only=""pencil"" />`
- The button is shown, but is fully transparent untill the user hovers over it.

**Example repo:**
The issue is reproducible in https://github.com/janwiebe-glasbergen/modus-button-bug

The main.component uses two modus components, modus-icon and modus-button.

If you run a `npm install` and `ng serve` in this repo you will see that the fill of the modus-button is set to transparent.

It will work fine when you do either one of these workarounds:
- Downgrade to 0.30.0 it is working fine.
- Extend the styles array in angular.json with:  `./node_modules/@trimble-oss/modus-web-components/dist/modus-web-components/modus-web-components.css`

- [X] I have read the [Modus style guidelines](https://modus.trimble.com/components/web/introduction/)

### Proposal

As of now, the autocomplete emits two events as follows
**optionSelected** => emits selected option ID 
**valueChange** => emits the selected option values as comma-separated string
As per these events, we don't have any option to know the option ID when is removed/de-selected

### Motivation and context

This is a basic feature available in the DevExtream [Tag Box](https://js.devexpress.com/Angular/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTagBox/Configuration/#onValueChanged) component. As part of migration, this is blocking us.

- [X] I have read the [Modus style guidelines](https://modus.trimble.com/components/web/introduction/)

### Proposal

Modus does not have a component which allows user to choose multiple options from a dropdown. Modus Select should have another prop 'multiple' which when set to true, allows user to choose multiple items which are then removed from the dropdown. 

The styling of options could mimic React Select


![example](https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components/assets/44625221/b6ea6d26-e778-49e9-a22f-5d5c9fd75bd6)

I think it could be helpful to somehow have that `sample.html` copied to the Storybook site so we can view it somehow without the Storybook styles/overhead. Something a bit like this:

### Describe the issue

When the Modus Button is used with the type `'submit'` or `'reset'`, they should interact directly with their parent `form` HTML element. I'm running into an issue where the parent `form`'s `onSubmit` and `onReset` functions do not fire when triggered by Modus Buttons:
```tsx
<form onSubmit={handleSubmit} onReset={handleCancel}>
    <div>
        <ModusButton
            type=""submit""
            disabled={hasFormErrors(formState)}
         >
             Submit

        <ModusButton color=""tertiary"" type=""reset"">
            Cancel
        </Button>
    </div>
</form>
```

I am assuming this is due to the elements being encapsulated under the Shadow DOM

- [X] I have read the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Describe the issue

When using Modus autocomplete with multi-select, the component behaves inconsistently based on initialization. If initialized with a single option, it recognizes  the value from list of options, allowing further selections. With no initial value, users can select options from the list, which are styled as chips. 
However, if initialized with multiple options (as a comma-separated list), the component fails to recognize them, displays a ""no results found"" message, and prevents further selections. Ideally, the autocomplete should recognize comma-separated values from the list, display them as chips, and allow additional selections.

### Describe the issue

The button group DOM Events (https://modus-web-components.trimble.com/?path=/docs/components-button-group--default) are documented as:
- buttonClick
- selectionChange

These aren't correct as they should be:
- buttonGroupClick
- buttonSelectionChange

What's interesting though is 'buttonClick' does fire but doesn't have any event data.

Finally, it is a deviation from most other functionality to have a HTML element be included in the DOM event, which it is for both buttonGroupClick and buttonSelectionChange. It adds fragility when working with frameworks.

- [X] I have read the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Describe the issue

Given the following HTML:

```
<modus-component aria-label=""""></modus-component>
```

library should render the following:
```
<modus-component aria-label="""">
    <div></div>
</modus-component>
```

But instead renders the following:
```
<modus-component aria-label="""">
    <div **aria-label=""""**></div>
</modus-component>
```
\*\*emphasis mine\*\*

(Note: In this case, `modus-component` is an abstraction and the `div` could be multiple layers deep or could be a `span`).

An example of where this is happening is on the [modal component](https://modus-web-components.trimble.com/?path=/story/components-modal--default&args=ariaLabel:).  Notice how `aria-label=""""` is found on the `.modus-modal` div.

### Describe the issue

When making a change to the project and running `npm run build`, files for Angular and React are autogenerated.   These show up on the stage when running `git status`.

How to reproduce:
1. Make a fresh branch
2. Make an update to a component's interface.
3. Run `npm run build`
4. Run `git status` (or check the Source Control section of VSCode)

Expected result: Only the files manually updated are in the stage.
Actual result: In addition to manually updated files, angular and react files are updated.

### Reduced test cases

In terminal/command line:

```
git rm <files to be gitignored>
git rm -r <directories to be gitignored>
```

In .gitignore:
```

We should support using the modus-autocomplete as a `cellEditorType`.  The scope of this is on edit, show autocomplete and on item select to set the value of the cell.  Make sure it works with text, badge, and hyperlink columns.

The issue occurs when using NGRX to populate a modus-table with selection mode on. Checking a box in the table shows ""Cannot assign to read only property 'id' of object '[object Object]' "" in the console.

1.) New flavor of autocomplete that shows all items when opened (rather than only showing items based on user input). I believe this needs to be a flavor only for the use cases when the list within the autocomplete is way too long. a.) it would confuse the user why everything is showing without knowing any context, and b,) it could take forever to load a potenially irrelevant list. 

2.) Scroll the list to the selected item (to assure user of their selection): once the user selects something from the autocomplete list, and reopens the autocomplete, they should see their selection within the context of the list. The already selected item item shows with a checkmark on the right and is the second one from the bottom of the list. 


**This is going to be addressed in a separate issue:** 
3.) If this is a multliselect autocomplete: show chips ABOVE the input field (not inside). When chips are created, and the field is reopened, the first selection in alphabetical order should be visible as the second from the bottom (unless it's the first one in the list or the last one in the list).

### Describe the issue

Currently when some option is selected, both optionSelected and valueChange events are triggered. 
When some option is unselected using chips, only valueChange event is triggered. 
When the string in input area changes, only valueChange event is triggered in this case too.

Value of target/datail of event is """" after erasing the last letter in input, even though there's some options selected. 
Value of target/datail of event is """" after closing the last chip.

So now, we cannot differentiate if the last chip is closed or the last letter of string is erased from input, as both triggers same valueChange event, where eventIn.detail = """" in both cases.

Thus we either need another event for closing chips or value should NOT be """" if there's still some options selected.

### Describe the issue

I would like to propose some changes to the Select component's `placeholder` property and its behavior:

**Optional placeholder Implementation**:
The `placeholder` property should be entirely optional. In the absence of  `placeholder`, the Select component should not display any placeholder text. Instead, the ""currently selected"" value should appear blank, aligning with the behavior observed in other input elements, such as text inputs

**Behavior When placeholder Is Specified**:
When `placeholder` is provided, it should exclusively serve as the ""currently selected"" value when no actual selection has been made. Importantly, this placeholder should not be included among the dropdown list's selectable options

Disabled buttons by default are hidden from screen readers. 

The solution for this is tricky but documented here: https://a11y-101.com/development/aria-disabled 

The solution should result in a button that is disabled (meaning it looks and acts disabled) BUT the screenreader still finds it and reads it as a button that is disabled.

2162078498,2226,Dropdown Component Encapsulation,['external-request'],"### Prerequisites

- [X] I have [searched](https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components/issues?q=is%3Aissue) for duplicate or closed feature requests
- [X] I have read the [Modus style guidelines](https://modus.trimble.com/components/web/introduction/)

### Proposal

I believe that the purpose of componentization is to encapsulate behavior of a group of elements together to perform a specific function. For example, the Table can combine an HTML table along with other modus components (such as pagination) to create a unified experience.

Dropdown I don't feel is this way as it relies on an extra button, passing the id between the dropdown and the button. I think the Dropdown component should already have a button embedded into it and expose the button label. Also using id's can lead to fragile component.

In addition, if `The dropdownList slot was built to work with the <modus-list> and <modus-list-item> elements.`, why not just make dropdown list items a formal component element as opposed to imposing requirements such as `The item size property should be set to 'condensed'.`?

Before:
```html
<modus-dropdown toggle-element-id=""toggleElement"">
  <modus-button id=""toggleElement"" slot=""dropdownToggle"" show-caret=""true"">Dropdown</modus-button>
  <modus-list slot=""dropdownList"">
    <modus-list-item size=""condensed"" borderless>Item 1</modus-list-item>
    <modus-list-item size=""condensed"" borderless>Item 2</modus-list-item>
    <modus-list-item size=""condensed"" borderless>Item 3</modus-list-item>
  </modus-list>
</modus-dropdown>
```

After:
```html
<modus-dropdown label=""Dropdown"">
  <modus-dropdown-item size=""condensed"" borderless>Item 1</modus-dropdown-item>
  <modus-dropdown-item size=""condensed"" borderless>Item 2</modus-dropdown-item>
  <modus-dropdown-item size=""condensed"" borderless>Item 3</modus-dropdown-item>
</modus-dropdown>
```

- [X] I have read the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Describe the issue

Max height is set on the table to support sticky headers. 
When the column visibility is enabled and the list of columns is very long, the list extends beyond the table itself, and causes additional scrolling within the page. 

![image](https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components/assets/4574058/a17a0208-ce91-4df4-b451-4864e66024ce)

**User Problem**

- Overlooking the Apply button as it is out of the page fold.
- Apply button too difficult to access as it needs long scroll to reach on long list of columns.

**Suggested Solution**
- Update column selection panel MAX-height ~~5% less than table height.
- Fixing the cancel and apply buttons to the bottom of the panel so that they are always visible
- The list of columns with checkboxes will be in the scrollable content of the selection panel.

2127481603,2137,Html Child Elements vs JS Property Inconsistencies,"['bug', 'external-request']","### Prerequisites

- [X] I have [searched](https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components/issues?q=is%3Aissue) for duplicate or closed issues
- [X] I have read the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Describe the issue

Note on Accordion, List, and some other types there are nice child elements for the parent type.

Note on Breadcrumb and Navbar, you are forced for some properties to use JS and not use child elements. I would like consistency and to have child elements as they are a cleaner way of structuring static content.

Example:

```html
<modus-breadcrumb></modus-breadcrumb>

<script>
  const modusBreadcrumb = document.querySelector('modus-breadcrumb');
  const crumbs = [
    { id: '1', display: 'Crumb 1' },
    { id: '2', display: 'Crumb 2' },
    { id: '3', display: 'Crumb 3' },
    { id: '4', display: 'Crumb 4' },
  ];
  modusBreadcrumb.crumbs = crumbs;
</script>
```

Could be:

```html
<modus-breadcrumb>
  <modus-breadcrumb-item item-id=""1"">Crumb 1</modus-breadcrumb-item>
  <modus-breadcrumb-item item-id=""2"">Crumb 2</modus-breadcrumb-item>
  <modus-breadcrumb-item item-id=""3"">Crumb 3</modus-breadcrumb-item>
  <modus-breadcrumb-item item-id=""4"">Crumb 4</modus-breadcrumb-item>
</modus-breadcrumb>
```

This change would still allow flexibility in JS, but would have a cleaner look and feel as well as support static OR prerendered data better.

Navbar:

```html
<modus-navbar
  id=""working""
  show-apps-menu
  show-help
  show-main-menu>
  <div slot=""main"" style=""height:300px;"">Render your own main menu.</div>

- [X] I have read the [Modus style guidelines](https://modus.trimble.com/components/web/introduction/)

### Proposal

Add a `show-profile` property to the Navbar, defaulting to `true`. We've decided to default to `true` to avoid introducing a breaking change, while also maintaining consistency with the existing `show-` prefix nomenclature in our properties.

### Motivation and context

There are scenarios where providing the user the option to sign out is unfavorable.  In the known instances, the profile menu is not necessary.  The provided scenarios were:
1. Tekla Assistant window that is opening a website inside a desktop application, providing user details or sign out options does not make sense in this context
2. e-Builder popup windows - Signing out from a popup window does not make sense based on desired user flow. The user should not be able to navigate to another page via profile menu links that take them back to the full page experience inside a popup window.  User delegation feature allows for switching of user context which could create confusion as the main page wouldn't update to reflect immediately.


Although this leads to the ability to use the `buttons` prop to define your own avatar button, this is not a supported use case by the modus design system.  To comply with guidelines, if a profile and profile menu are needed then the built in profile should be used.

- User can sort by clicking on the header text OR on the sort icon. When sorted, the icon changes and the header text becomes bold. Clicking again reverses the sort order.

- User can click within the cell on empty space, the drag cursor (open hand) shows on hover and once clicked and dragged (cursor changes to closed hand) the column can be reordered. 

- When the user tabs into the column header, the screenreader reads the content of the cell. When the user presses enter, the column header is raised to indicate the user can reorder columns with left/right arrows. 

- When the user tabs again, the focus moves to the sort icon allowing the user to sort by pressing enter.

- [X] I have read the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Describe the issue

The pagination of the modus-table is not working correctly when it get's enabled after the page loaded. 
It looks like the 'showing result' and pages are rendered correctly, but the data in the table is never updated.

After a refresh of the web-page the pagination works like expected.



### Reduced test cases

Steps to reproduce in storyboard canvas:
- Open the default modus-table
- Set the pageSizeList prop to `[2,3,5]`
- Set the pagination prop to `true`
- Pagination is shown, but not working correctly:
  - Before showing the pagination there is a short period in when it shows:  'Showing result NaN - NaN of 5' (see image).

  - Total count shows 'showing result 1 - 2 of 5', but table shows all 5 results.
  - Switching the page doesn't affect the result in the table
  - Switching the page view doesn't affect the result in the table

2109347908,2095,Date Picker - Available dates should dynamically update to reflect the latest changes without requiring a manual refresh.,"['bug', 'external-request']","### Prerequisites

- [X] I have [searched](https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components/issues?q=is%3Aissue) for duplicate or closed issues
- [X] I have read the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Describe the issue

**Bug Description:**
The Date Picker component in the Modus Web Components library presents an issue when modifying the minimum and maximum dates using the UI controls. Specifically, when selecting a date that falls below the minimum date or exceeds the maximum date, navigating to available dates in the calendar does not update to reflect the latest changes. A manual refresh of the URL is required to observe the correct behavior.

### Reduced test cases


**Expected Behavior:**
After modifying the minimum and maximum dates and selecting a date outside the valid range, navigating to available dates should dynamically update to reflect the latest changes without requiring a manual refresh.


**Technical Scenario:**

- Access the URL(https://modus-web-components.trimble.com/?path=/story/user-inputs-date-picker--default-with-picker).
- Observe the Date Picker component, focusing on the ""default-with-picker"" story.
- Modify the minimum date to ""2022-12-02"" and the maximum date to ""2023-01-31"" using the Date Picker component UI controls.
- Set the current date value to ""2023-12-22.""
- Select a date that falls below the minimum date or exceeds the maximum date (e.g., choose a date in December 2022).
- Click on the calendar and navigate to available dates.
- Observe that the calendar displays dates from December 2022, and all dates beyond this month are disabled.
- Manually refresh the URL and verify that the changes are correctly reflected in the calendar.

**Test Data:**

[Test URL](https://modus-web-components.trimble.com/?path=/story/user-inputs-date-picker--default-with-picker)
Existing Minimum Date: 2022-12-02
Existing Maximum Date: 2022-12-30
Current Date Value: 2022-12-22
Updated Maximum Date: 2023-01-31

### Describe the issue

I have a build using modus-web-components and modus-react-components. When a selected data row is deleted, the next record is automatically selected. This behavior is not what one would expect when using an interactive table and requires a workaround to unselect the element that is automatically selected.

Overview of steps:
- Create a modus-table with row-selection.
- Select a row.
- Remove the selected row from the data array.
- The next record is automatically selected.

Select the row:
![42fadb2c-5583-45ff-af8c-431a3b7b01e3](https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components/assets/49401240/086749a2-a412-4e78-879b-c36fc72ada88)

Delete the item:

### Proposal


Add the ability on the table component to switch the sort icon set to the icons listed here: https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-icons/issues/353



### Motivation and context

We received feedback from users that they cannot see when the column is sorted. It is hard to notice which column is sorting the table. Also, the A-Z icon is confusing if you're sorting numerical data. We propose a one-arrow icon that is simpler to understand.

2102107200,2076,Modal Accessibility Issues,"['3', 'priority:medium', 'accessibility']","The Modal Component has a few accessibility issues:

- A closed/unopened Modal should not have `role=""dialog""`, that should be added when modal is opened and removed when modal is closed.
- Modal should have `aria-modal=""true""` when opened (removed when closed)
- Modal should not have `aria-label` when closed.
- Modal should have `aria-hidden=""true""` when closed
- Right now, the `aria-label` has to manually set and is listed as 'optional'. I think it'd be better if the value of the modal title was used automatically. The title would have an id (e.g. `id=""contactFormModalTitle""`, and the modal would then have something like `aria-labelledby=""contactFormModalTitle""` then no need for aria-label to be used at all (this is what Bootstrap does)"

Component creates `iconClick` event
```tsx

```
But Storybook shows it has having an `onClick` event that is emitted

And when the icon is clicked it produces an error
```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'emit')
    at Object.onClick (25.cf0f1bcf.iframe.bundle.js:1:2565)
    at IconSun.Object.onClick (0.fb127b46.iframe.bundle.js:1:421530)
```

This is caused by the icons onClick being set as
```html
<IconMap ... onClick={this.onClick} ... />
```
when it should be this at minimum to maintain the `this` context.  
```html
<IconMap ... onClick={() => this.onClick()} ... />
```

Otherwise the context will be the icon from the icon map, not the modus-icon.

I am creating this ticket so I can work on it later.

2066482330,1998,Table: Add support for wrapping text,"['external-request', 'team-e-builder', 'modus-approved']","### Prerequisites

- [X] I have [searched](https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components/issues?q=is%3Aissue) for duplicate or closed feature requests
- [X] I have read the [Modus style guidelines](https://modus.trimble.com/components/web/introduction/)

### Proposal

The table should allow for the text to wrap, instead of being truncated.  Since the current table is setup to truncate by default, we should leave that.  My suggestion is to add a `wrap-text` property that defaults to `false`.  When enabled, it will remove the css that currently causes the body text to be truncated with ellipsis.  I do not expect this setting to affect the header or the footer.

Additionally, padding needs to be maintained.  Currently, the `<tr>` has its height set relative to its `density`.  Each column type should ensure that it's effective padding is maintained between wrapping and non-wrapping configurations.

Currently looks like this:
![image](https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components/assets/1130129/e82e1d1b-c11b-484c-9647-9bc3d435e6c6)

After changes, it could look like this:

### Motivation and context

Currently columns are displayed which can show a large block of text.  Since this text is truncated, users cannot scan or otherwise search for a specific row based on the value of the cell.  By adding back text wrapping, the table can function the same as a standard table and gives us the control on whether its more valuable to have fixed and predictable row heights, or all the text in the cells being displayed with irregular row heights.

In a paginated table, when you remove or add a row, the first page is shown. However the previous page is still selected.

**Steps to reproduce:**
* Create a paginated table
* Navigate to the last page
* Add or remove item from the data array
* Table shows first page, but last page is still selected in the page navigation

* Configure the maxSize property on the column
* Enter a value that causes a cell bigger than the max width.

### Proposal

We need the checkbox component to support different sizes within the Table component. 
Within the storybook site, we need to be able to set the various properties of the modus-checkbox component for the “row selection” feature. 

rowSelectionOptions is likely the best place

- [X] I have read the [Modus style guidelines](https://modus.trimble.com/components/web/introduction/)

### Proposal

Currently, the modus content tree component offers only a single slot for the label of the content tree items. 
This epic is to update the content tree to offer a slots - “groupRight” slot (similar to the slots for the modus table) 

![image](https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components/assets/48927186/b5cc7b1c-0b3c-4588-b5e8-38031f8e7e17)

This would allow the label slot to be used when only a label is needed but support actions on content where needed.

### Describe the issue

The Apps and User menus seem to have some issues after recent updates.
I also observed an issue with buttons that do not use menus in the navbar, they display a bottom border color when the menu would have been open if it used one (see the moon button in the example images below).

Apps Menu:
- Menu padding incorrect
- Section line separator color incorrect

User Menu:
- Long username and emails incorrectly centered

Navbar Buttons with hidden menus:
- Shows bottom border line

- [X] I have read the [Modus style guidelines](https://modus.trimble.com/components/web/introduction/)

### Proposal

The scope of this change would be to add a sub-text under the slot in the Modus List Item. We will use that to show the user details in user delegation below username within e-Builder

<img width=""202"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components/assets/98008242/fdde2e00-33dc-4ac0-939f-47e325dc7901"">


### Motivation and context

We have a user delegation feature in e-builder which requires the company name to appear below the username. In order to maintain that feature and use the Modus NavBar, we need to add sub-text below the slot in the Modus-List-Item component. By adding support for sub-text, we can easily show a two-line dropdown using the Modus-List-Item component.

Users can currently enable a vertical scroll on the table by adjusting the `maxHeight` parameter. When scrolling through the table, the header row remains fixed, as shown in the screenshot (https://modus-web-components.trimble.com/?path=/story/components-table--pagination&args=maxHeight:700px).

By updating to use quotes
```
stylelint ""src/**/*.scss"" --fix
prettier --write ""storybook/stories/**/*.*"" ""src/**/*.*"" --config ../.prettierrc.json --ignore-path ../.prettierignore
```

At least per prettier [documentation](https://prettier.io/docs/en/cli.html): 
> Don’t forget the quotes around the globs! The quotes make sure that Prettier CLI expands the globs rather than your shell, which is important for cross-platform usage.

I'll make this update.

### Describe the issue

We found an issue with the Modus Select. It behaves differently between optimized code and unoptimized code and because of that the logic written for default value and onValueChanged differs.
Below it's a picture on how a list looks like in 2 different environments one optimize and one not:

I noticed the issue also in the docs https://modus-web-components.trimble.com/?path=/docs/user-inputs-select--default 
In the official docs you have e.details as the result value of an value change - which happened for us in optimized code
and in the canvas, the result is actually e.detail.display, what we saw in unoptimized code

- Pasting into a single column.
- Pasting into multiple rows and columns

For this to work you'd need to be able to select all of the cells in a table and paste into them. You'd also need to be able to select an entire row or an entire column.

1995348707,1889,Default icon color inconsistencies,"['3', 'priority:medium', 'bug', 'external-request']","### Prerequisites

- [X] I have read the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Describe the issue

There are some inconsistencies in the default icon colors that have made it harder to keep behavior consistent across all icons.
The inconsistencies are:
1. Which elements the fill color property values are set on. Some set the fill on the `svg`, and others on the `path` elements.
2. Which colors are used as the default values for those properties. Some use `'currentColor'`, others use `#6A6976` or `#252a2e`

To resolve these issue and improve icon consistency, I suggest a few changes:
1. Use the `fill` property on the `svg` elements inside of the icon components, rather than the `path` elements
2. Default the `fill` property value to `'currentColor'` - which means that the fill color of that path will be the same as the color property of the element or its parent element (see example: https://jsfiddle.net/s4c1e2nu/1/)
3. Use a constant value for the icon default size of `16`

- [X] I have read the [Modus style guidelines](https://modus.trimble.com/components/web/introduction/)

### Proposal

Currently using the tabs component is done so by providing an object list of the tabs to add. This poses an issue for us when supplying translation strings in angular, since the html template is responsible for translating; I imagine this is a more general issue with translations that isn't specific to angular.

I'm proposing altering the way tabs work to use slotted content for each tab (a good example of this can be found [here](https://shoelace.style/components/tab-group)). This makes it much easier for an implementer to use the tabs component.

Additionally, tab components tend to include slots for the content to display when each tab is active. This is less of a requirement and more of a nice to have if possible.

### Motivation and context

Providing component layout via an object rather that through slotted/projected content is not a developer friendly way of doing things. It also requires that the implementer looks after the state of the current active tab in order to render content relating to the tab. This is something the Modus component could do for us.

- [X] I have read the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Describe the issue

Column reorder is not working properly when we drag and drop the column to an specific place,
it always go to the last column.

- when we're creating a table and set the column 
ex:
 `modusTable.columns = [ { id: 'first-name' } ];`

it's generating a dynamic ID to identify the table (in cases that we're creating more than one table)

this dynamic ID is going to be placed in the DOM element 

ex 
`<th id=""asdfsd3er2ertgdfer_first-name"">`

so when we're dragging and dropping, it's trying to find `first-name` but it can't find the element with the generated ID and that's why is putting the column at the end.

This changes is to update the `columns` and `columnReorder` in the tableOptions to set the properly ID and fix the reorder behavior

- [X] I have read the [Modus style guidelines](https://modus.trimble.com/components/web/introduction/)

### Proposal

The modus icon set includes hundreds of icons out of the box, however it looks like the vast majority of them are not available in modus web components. Whilst I understand that people have requested icons on a case-by-case basis, it doesn't make sense to me that these are added ad-hoc. In my opinion, if Modus WCs support modus icons, then all icons should be available for use. 

I can see in the source code that you are using the svg's directly and have individual components for each, which probably explains why all the icons have not yet been implemented, however an alternative approach might be to use the modus icons font as this would support all icons out of the box and any future changes to modus icons would be very easy to update to.

### Motivation and context

A lot of the icons we use in our products are not currently in Modus WCs. We are currently starting work to transition from our own Modus-based UI library to using Modus WCs

As per the initial Table prototype shared by the Tables Tiger team, Row actions were added in the first column of the table. However, an accessibility issue was recently identified regarding the placement of row actions in the first column. To address this issue, it was decided to move the row actions to the last column, similar to the Modus Data Table. 

Find the updated design in the [Figma prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/7yC5vYgdbzqaEJDr566xAL/SUBMISSION-V1---Work-in-Progress?type=design&node-id=1531-53772&mode=design&t=R4IeYa4ktRJgYNiw-0). The initial issue number was #https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components/issues/1729.

### Proposal

From @coliff,

- **RSS**: The https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components/releases page has an RSS feed. If you use an RSS feed reader enter the URL and you'll get notified on each new release. I do this personally for some packages

- **GitHub Notifications**: There is a 'Watch' dropdown on the repo page https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components and you can choose to get notifications on new releases from there. You can set up notifications for these. I use the browser extension which works really well: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/notifier-for-github/lmjdlojahmbbcodnpecnjnmlddbkjhnn

- **Dependabot for GitHub**: If you use GitHub to host your code you can set up dependabot to automatically create a PR for new dependencies. It's very configurable - you can choose how often to check (daily, weekly or monthly). We use this on all the Modus projects and it can be integrated with CI/CD so you can get a deploy preview with each dependency update. https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuring-dependabot-version-updates

- **Node Check Updates**: You can add a script to your package.json and name it something like 'check-updates' and enter the script: npx npm-check-updates. It'll check for updates and report which ones are available. You can even configure it to automatically update dependencies if you want and exclude others. I use this regularly and recommend it. Read more about it at: https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates

### Proposal
Slots allow users to add any content to a Web component.


For Example, In the Modus List Item, users can add any content using the default `slot`. However, we can provide more detailed information about what type of content is allowed and what is not recommended to ensure that users stay within the Modus guidelines. This will help users understand the boundaries of the Modus List Item and prevent them from deviating from the recommended usage. Another example is content tree.

- [X] I have read the [Modus style guidelines](https://modus.trimble.com/components/web/introduction/)

### Proposal

If the date input is being used with a picker and min and max properties have been set to the input and the user typed a date to the input that is out of the min-max range then when the user clicks on the calendar icon then open a calendar widget on the month that has available dates and is closer to the min-max date.

When the selected date is before the min-max range - then open a calendar on the min date.
When the selected date is after the min-max range - then open a calendar on the max date.

Current result:

- Properties set:

All available dates are in the previous month so it should be shown by default:

### Reduced test cases

Expected Behavior:
Close button size to remain constant.
The chip container should grow to the filled text or an option to clip the overflow text with an ellipsis.

### Proposal

We would like the navbar profile menu items to have the ability to add an optional icon to the left of each profile menu link item. This would mean adding icon fields to the `ModusProfileMenuOptions` interface.

Use case: Our UX requested that these options were added

1928826420,1764,Modus-Modal | Tooltip for a disabled primary button,"['priority:low', 'external-request', 'team-e-builder', 'team-phoenix', 'not-official']","### Prerequisites

- [X] I have read the [Modus style guidelines](https://modus.trimble.com/components/web/introduction/)

### Proposal

We should be able to give the reason why the primary button is disabled so that users can take action to enable the button.

The tooltip doesn't have to be visible when the button isn't disabled, I just need to be able to control it at the same time the button is disableddisable the button

Here's a link to the figma for the change, note the tool tip present above the button labeled ""yes, update retainage""
![image](https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components/assets/109538462/95c080e6-24bb-44ec-8545-c472db51d32e)


### Motivation and context

We need to maintain a high level of accessibility in our product. If someone was using a screen reader to aid them in completing this work they may have trouble figuring out how to enable the button that is disabled.

Here are the design requirements written by UX for the ticket I'm working on. It should provide some specific implementation details and other guidelines and context
```
 Design


The accessible name of a tooltip can come from the contents, or from an aria-label or aria-labelledby.

position: top

text: “You must enter a percent to continue.”

aria-label: “You must enter a percent to continue.”

The tooltip should appear on focus or when the element is hovered on after a 2 second delay.

It displays and disappears via keyboard focus and removal of focus and by the mouse events - mousing over and mousing out.

The tooltip never receives focus. Focus stays on the owning element.

Escape key closes it if its open

The element that serves as the tooltip container has role=""tooltip"" set.

The element that triggers the tooltip references the tooltip element with aria-describedby and references the ID of the container with the tooltip text

### Proposal

Currently the ContentTreeItem component handles the ItemClick event. We'd also like similar event handling for cases involving Ctrl+Click and Shift+ArrowKeys or a single event handler for when the selection is changed.

### Motivation and context

In Creator we use the Content Tree to reflect the structure of the 3D object hiearachy in the in the viewer. Whenever we select an item in the ContentTree the same 3D object needs to be (de)selected. Single selection can be handled though the ItemClick event, but this does not handle cases where Ctrl+Click and Shift+ArrowKeys is used to select an item.

- [X] I have read the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Describe the issue

I'd like to bring attention to a specific issue related to manually entering dates in the date picker field, rather than selecting them from the calendar. In such cases, I've observed the following problems:

**Incorrect Handling of Invalid Dates:** When entering an invalid date like ""31-09-2023,"" the calendar interprets it as ""01-09-2023."" This behaviour is inaccurate, and it would be more appropriate to implement validation that highlights or notifies users about such errors.

**Handling of Invalid Dates like 30-02-2023:** Similarly, when inputting an invalid date like ""30-02-2023,"" the calendar interprets it as ""02-03-2023."" and it would be beneficial to implement validation that either highlights the error or prevents the entry of such invalid dates during manual input.

I believe addressing these issues would improve the accuracy and reliability of the date picker's manual input functionality. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

### Proposal

When trying to view a kebab menu within an accordion it is not possible to display the menu option items, 
The menu items  must be independently positioned  so that you can see the options outside the accordion and not inside where it loses visibility.


This functionality can be achieved with styles changes for  some modus-accordion  Shadow DOM elements.
Here’s a link with a brief example (this example is not complete at all because there’s some elements that are placed inside a shadow-dom, if we set UL tag for modus-list-item with position:unset, we can see the Kebab menu list item (ellipsis menu items).

I want to report an issue with the date picker. The problem is that the calendar dates and days shown don't match the actual calendar. Every month, the first date is set as Sunday, which is incorrect. This could confuse users who rely on accurate dates. Please look into this and fix it. Thank you.

### Describe the issue

The Select component should only use the `optionsDisplayProp` for displaying the text value in the select. Selection and the current value should depend on whatever object/value is currently selected:

```tsx
const options = [{ id: 0, display: 'Option1' }, { id: 1, display: 'Option2' }];
<Select options={options} value={options[0]} options-display-prop=""display"" />

// *click Option2*

RE: Slider - https://modus-web-components.trimble.com/?path=/docs/components-slider--default

It'd be good if the range slider supported adding a `name`, `id` and `list` property as well as a linked `datalist`.

See MDN for an example: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/range#adding_tick_marks

1817796466,1569,Modus components inside an angular web app is too small,"['3', 'priority:low', 'bug', 'external-request', 'modus-approved']","### Describe the issue

Hi guys,

I was trying to test this modus web components design framework and checking the compatibility within some of our software products. For my case, I am using this on Angular 15 (and would go for Angular 16 soon)

The components are working but it seems that it was too zoomed out (or too small) for a reason. check below.

![image](https://github.com/trimble-oss/website-modus.trimble.com/assets/1312938/0edcf05d-d255-418f-bacd-86908ff6cda5)

is there a way to override some of the css classes here? I have seen that the `#shadow-root` stops me to do some things.

![image](https://github.com/trimble-oss/website-modus.trimble.com/assets/1312938/a3976272-6616-46e3-8515-57deb99f5cd8)

Thanks

PS.
I have also added `size=large` seems too small. (has computed height size of `30px`)

- [X] I have [searched](https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components/issues?q=is%3Aissue) for duplicate or closed feature requests
- [X] I have read the [Modus style guidelines](https://modus.trimble.com/components/web/introduction/)

### Proposal

In the modus modal component a new property ""backdrop"" is required.
This would accept 3 values - true, false, ""static""
When the backdrop is ""static"" - the modal does not close when we click outside the modal.
When the backdrop is false - the background of the modal is not an opaque screen, the background would be the same page, The modal would not also be closed once clicked outside the modal.
When the backdrop is true ( default mode ) - the backdrop is an opaque image, as usual and the modal would close once clicked outside the modal.

Below is the example for the expected way the backdrop=""static"" to work,
![backdrop-static](https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components/assets/132334449/fa67d180-960e-41ce-b124-ad54944127cb)

Below is the example for the expected way the backdrop=false to work,
![backdrop-false](https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components/assets/132334449/f1f34078-d59b-4c49-a626-3d3ec931c581)


Below is the example for the expected way the backdrop=true to work,

### Motivation and context

We had a feature in our application where we make a background call on submitting the modal submit.
We then show the details from the response in the modal itself.
But while we progress the API-call in the background, if the user clicks anywhere outside the modal, the modal.close() is triggered and it gets closed.
Hence the process is interrupted.

- [X] I have read the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Describe the issue

Modus Table - data disappears when ordering is reset to 'none'.

When using redux to store the state of the data that should be displayed in the table the following issue arises:

1. Change ordering of a column three times so it is reset to 'none'
2. On reset to 'none' the data inside the table disappears. Note: It is still part of the redux state



### Reduced test cases

A workaround for this case is to dispatch the loadAction again, albeit an ugly fix.

### Proposal

Modus Table - Column Resize - Keyboard navigation - Escape key functionality to be implemented

Scenario: When user hit enter key or spacebar to resize the column, and then decides not to proceed with column resize. 

**Expected result:** If user hit escape key, the selection to resize column should be deselected and user should be able to proceed further.
**Actual Result:** User will have to hit on tab key to proceed further

### Proposal

Modus Table - Column Reorder- Keyboard navigation - Escape key functionality to be implemented

On mouse navigation - User will click on the header and start dragging to reorder and in between decides not to change the position of selected column he can go back to the existing place of the header and leave the mouse click. This will result in no changes
image

no change after the mouse is released on the same column header

In case of Keyboard navigation: When User Hit enter key, the column header can be moved further or beside any existing column. when tried to hit enter placing it on the same header or if user hit escape key there is no action performed. It just stays on the same place as shown in the screenshot:

It is expected to be released when user hit on escape key, as the user does not want to proceed with column reorder. As this is how it works with mouse navigation.

### Describe the issue

Hello,

While trying to implement accessibility on modus-modal, We have shifted the focus to a modus-text-input on modal. 
We see the below 3 issues.

1. Upon pressing tab few times on keyboard, the focus doesn't stay on modus-modal. It shifts to the back
2. The focus doesn't shif tto close button on top right corner.
3. When pressing escape button on keyboard, it doesn't close the modus-modal.

See below how our Modal looks.

### Proposal

Now that the library is mature enough to start introducing breaking changes, we should discuss how we want to help consumers update their usages when breaking changes occur

I see 3 options:
1. A markdown file called `UPDATE_GUIDE.md` at the repository root
2. A page in the Storybook site
3. An interactive site that let's the user pick which version they are starting with and which version they are updating to. That would then generate all the necessary steps they would take to update. This is a larger effort, and possibly overkill for the speed of development of this project

Either way, I think these options would all contain the same information: a descriptive list of what has been removed/deprecated and how to resolve issues that arise while updating from one version to the next

### Proposal

Modus Chip close icon uses `icon-remove` which is different from the icon described in Modus Style Guide (https://modus.trimble.com/components/web/chips/styles/). That one is `icon-close`. A possible solution is to add a new optional property where the consumer can decide which they want to use. Possible name: `closeIcon`.
Also, the chip height is different when the icons are visible

The padding-top and padding-bottom are 0 if there is no icon. 
`&.no-left-icon.no-right-icon {
    padding: 0 $rem-16px;

It should be the same always

### Describe the issue

- The dropdown isn't accessible via keyboard Enter.
- User will hit on tab key to select the first option on Select component ""Select Demo1"" and then hit on Enter key for the dropdown values to be displayed. Select any of the option by hitting Enter key, once the option is selected, it is expected that the dropdown should auto close.
 However this works fine when user does the action on mouse click, the same should work for action performed through keyboard.

- [X] I have read the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Proposal

Allow for the user icon to have its border and initial background color to be configurable. 

Presently, the avatar image / initials span are given borders when active, focused, and hovered.  This proposal is to allow for a border color to exist when not interacted with.  Presently, we cannot control whether the border is showing, nor what color it is.  The implementation details are TBD.

### Proposal

We were given the following UX, shown below. We will ensure alignment with Modus Design System and Modus Web Components teams before starting work

The scope of this change would be to add a `slot` under the profile menu links.  We will use that for user delegation within e-Builder, but would leave this area generic to allow it to be flexible.

**Tasks**
1. Add `slot` area to User Profile Menu
2. Handle styling when there is and isn't content to be added.

It is e-Builder's intent to work on this request.

### Motivation and context

We have a user delegation feature in e-Builder which allows a user to work on behalf of another individual. In order to maintain that feature and use the Modus NavBar, we require an area enable user context switching.  By making it a slot, we enable reusability and flexibility with its use.

- [X] I have read the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Proposal

Toggle the product logo with a smaller icon variant at the `Small` breakpoint of 576px for responsiveness.

We do one of the following:
1. Add a property to `productLogoOptions` for `smallUrl` (or `iconUrl` though icon may be confusing).
2. Redefine the interface for `productLogoOptions` with a property for `logo` and one for `icon` which can each then have a `height` and `url` property.
3.  Rename `url` to `logoUrl` and add `iconUrl`.  We could have `url` as deprecated, and overridden with `logoUrl` to phase it in.

Then we would add `@media (min-width: 576px)` as needed to show one image or the other as is currently done with the bootstrap implementation.

Example change

- [X] I have [searched](https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components/issues?q=is%3Aissue) for duplicate or closed feature requests
- [X] I have read the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/trimble-oss/modus-web-components/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Proposal

Stencil supports outputting the components as a `vscode-data.json` file which can be used in VS Code to autocomplete all the Modus Web Component element names and properties.
https://stenciljs.com/docs/docs-vscode

It's an awesome feature and will give developers a big productivity boost as it includes documentation (on hover). The popular Shoelace Web Component library includes it in their npm package so all developers can add it to their `.vscode/settings.json`.
https://shoelace.style/getting-started/usage?id=code-completion

It should be quite easy for us to add this by adding the output option to `stencil.config.ts` and making sure the generated JSON is included in the npm package. Then we just need to update the README and website to let people know.

### Motivation and context

This will be a great productivity boost for developers using VS Code... and the file will automatically update with each release.

- Having an interactive search button inside the field. It means we don't need to add an extra button outside of the field to search. It just looks a lot cleaner in my opinion.
- Just added the option to have a button on the right of the inside field
- Adding a 24px x 24px button to the write of a text input field.
- Has a hover and pressed state. When clicked it will (in my case) perform the search.

Implement 'dark' and 'light' theme setting for the web components
*Maybe* add a 'preference' mode which will automatically apply the user's preferred theme? This could be its own story outside of the Barebones requirements

There should be two ways to set the theme:
- [x] Page Level - Set the theme on the page's body with a class that the components can read from. This would apply the theme globally
- [x] Component Level - Set the theme directly on the component with a CSS attribute, which would override the Page Level setter

1288946501,529,The Modus Modal component is not mobile friendly,['bug'],"**Description of the bug**
When you click on a button that opens a modus modal component on a mobile device, a large portion of the modal's content gets cut off because it is on a smaller screen. 

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Be on a screen of about 375px in width
2. Click on a button that opens a modal
3. Observe the width of the modal and how some of its contents are cutoff

**Expected behavior**
Whether you are on mobile or desktop, you should be able to see the full contents of the modal. You should be able to click on all of the buttons and complete all actions on the modal, regardless of screen size. 

**Screenshots**
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95942407/176481899-e6ee52c4-aa39-4c9c-8df9-4aa2e286be87.png)
in the above screenshot, you can see that the modal is too high up on the page of a mobile device and the right side action buttons are cutoff.

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: Windows
 - Browser Chrome

**Additional context**
After testing in dev tools, this seems like it would be a good fix for the CSS: 

```css
.modus-modal .content {
   background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);
   border: 0.0625rem solid rgb(136, 136, 136);
   display: flex;
   flex-direction: column;
   justify-content: center;
   margin: 25% auto;
   max-width: 650px;
   padding: 0px 1rem;
}
```

What was changed in the above CSS: 
* min-width: 375 was removed
* width: max-content was removed
* margin: 15% auto was changed to margin: 25% auto

1095962761,237,Improvement Research,['spike'],"Now that the initial development of the component library is finished, let's look into what could make this project even better.

(Feel free to add to this issue as you see fit, or add a comment below)

Some initial questions:
- Is it alright to have both composable and non-composable components in the library? Is that bad for consistency?
- Are the DOM events we have currently alright? Do we need to rename, add, or change any?
- How are other libraries handling internationalization?
- Do we need to handle custom styling better?
- Are we following the style guide proposed by Stenciljs?
- Should we expose more public methods, rather than having the component's property be set?

Other libraries built on Stenciljs similar to MWC:
- Bulmi library using Storybook: https://github.com/Gomah/bulmil

```
MWC Improvements -
	+ Our own CDN hosting
	
	+ Create and consume a shared styling package
	
	+ More detailed docs about consumption
	
	+ Better content for open sourcing
	
	+ Modus Table Component

        + Modus Content Tree Component
	
	+ Standardize naming, and component conventions (style-guide)
	
	+ Dark Mode
	
	+ Better Accessibility
	
	+ Component Responsiveness/Internationalization
	
	+ Wrapper libraries for (autogenerated?):
		- Angular
		- React
		- Vue
	
	+ Installation Demos (repositories, videos, etc...)
	
	+ Build a workflow for getting new components into the library. This would include:
		- Adding a review repository that developers can submit their components to
		- Review and update processes
		- Review -> Design System?
		- Review -> MWC
	    > This could also be a separate library filled with Organisms, 
                    where the MWC library would contain the Atoms

- Keyboard controls

## Aria attributes
Web Accessibility Initiative, Accessible Rich Internet Applications

WAI-ARIA helps by adding in further semantics that browsers and assistive technologies can recognize and use to let users know what is going on. 

There are three main features:
1. Roles - The role defines what an element is or does. There are different types (document roles, widget roles, landmark roles, etc.) The ones we'll be focusing on for this project are [widget roles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles#2._widget_roles).
2. Properties - The properties define the parts of an element. (aries-required, arialabelledby, etc.) Here is a list of [aria properties and states that widgets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques#widget_attributes) use.
3. States - Similar to properties, they describe the state of your widget. Linked above.

One of the questions I had was whether we wanted to have the library consumer pass in all of our WAI-ARIA properties, but it seems like it's going to be a mixed bag. We want to encapsulate as much as we can without hindering the consumer. I think we can set `role`, `state`, and some `properties` internally. One thing I can see the consumer wanting to set is the `label`.

WC essential internal settings:
- role
- aria-checked
- aria-disabled
- aria-hidden, aria-modal
- aria-invalid
- aria-placeholder
- aria-pressed
- aria-readonly
- aria-required
- aria-valuemax
- aria-valuemin
- aria-valuenow
- aria-labelledby (which is used with aria-label?)

WC optional external settings:
- aria-label

## Tab index/order
Tabindex is an HTML attribute that can set an order for focusable elements which allow keyboard focus for non focusable elements and remove focus for a focusable element.

From what I'm seeing, it looks the best practice is to use only values `-1`, and `0`. This is because once you start adding positive integers, it breaks off the DOMs natural tabbing order; tabbing follows the DOMs element layout naturally, and it is best to stick to that if we can.

`tabindex: -1` - Does not allow the user to select with their tab key, but is able to be focused through JS.
`tabindex: 0` - Allows non focusable elements to receive focus.

For the WC, I'm thinking we should set a tabindex of 0 for ones that should be focusable, and then rely on keyboard controls for any further interaction. Let's shy away of using tabbing to interact with the control other than focusing it. 

## Keyboard events
Using Stencil's `Listen()` decorator, we can listen to keyboard events and interact with the component accordingly. Gabe's got a good example in the `modus-select` component.

Using the w3 documentation below.

## Questions
- Does stencil provide a way of setting properties on the host element? This may be useful for our labelling so that the consumer does not need to know best practices, and we can implement it for them. -- Or is this even an issue? There may be good reason to keep everything encapsulated in the ShadowDOM, I have a feeling the DOM cannot access those and relate them.

### Useful links
